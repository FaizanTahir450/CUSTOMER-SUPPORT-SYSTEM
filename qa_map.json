    "question": "recipr fpr thai green curry",
    "answer": "Unfortunately, there is no explicit recipe for \"Thai Green Curry\" in the provided text. However, I can suggest a possible relevant recipe based on the information available:\n\n**Tom Kha Kai (Coconut Soup with Chicken)** could be used as a substitute for Thai Green Curry since it contains coconut milk and lemongrass, which are common ingredients in green curry.\n\nHere is a simplified recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 cups chicken breast or thighs\n* 2 cups coconut milk\n* 1 cup water\n* 4-5 bird's eye chilies (adjust to desired spiciness)\n* 2 cloves garlic\n* 1 tablespoon grated ginger\n* 1 tablespoon fish sauce\n* 1 tablespoon lime juice\n* 1 tablespoon palm sugar\n* 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper\n* 2 stalks lemongrass, bruised\n* Salt to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. In a large pot, combine chicken, coconut milk, water, chilies, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, lime juice, palm sugar, and white pepper.\n2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.\n3. Add lemongrass and stir well.\n4. Serve hot with steamed rice.\n\nNote that this recipe may not be an exact replica of Thai Green Curry, but it incorporates many common ingredients used in green curry dishes.",
